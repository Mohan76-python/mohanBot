# 🤖 mohanBot — A Simple Python Chatbot

Welcome to **mohanBot**, a lightweight and fun command-line chatbot built with Python. Whether you're bored, curious, or just want to chat with a bot that has a bit of personality, mohanBot is here for you!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Friendly greetings and responses
- Recognizes basic conversational phrases
- Tells a programmer joke 🐛
- Random fallback replies to keep the chat going
- Clean exit with `"bye"` or `"exit"`

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot uses simple `if-elif` logic and a list of randomized fallback responses to simulate conversation. It runs in an infinite loop until the user types `"bye"` or `"exit"`.
